# Why i love Svelte üòç

Iam a Aeronautical engineer by training , And started working for the same.But When covid hit like many i wanted to re-orient my career.
So I thought of getting into IT.

I was always interested in software development from my college days. So i wanted to get started with this feild.

As a everyone who gets into software-development i started with udemy , i did courses on web development [this course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/) gave me a proper intro to web development. As of all courses it introduced me to react.

React felt like a awesome tool i started experimenting implementing demo and test projects with it. That was the time(early 2020's) when react hooks started to get traction, so it was a natural and default for me to get into reactcamp.

But then i saw the awesome [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdNJ3fydeao) by
**Rich Harris**
on youtube by thanks to youtube's algorithm. My mind was blown.

## Reactivity like Magic

Svelete felt like magic its reactivity model was what pulled me towards it. I was a early adopter of the svelte3.I had tried [vue](https://vuejs.org/) but it was bit too much of javascript for me.

Svelte's use of assignment as trigger for the ui change felt soo natural to me.

## Learning

Just go through svelet's wonderfull [tutorial](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/basics) driven docs and you will be up and running with a website in no time.
It contains all examples from reactivity , param passing even **_animations_**. The built in **tweened** and **spring** the **_transition_** directive all these built in features which are like pretty easy to implement will get any novice programmer do wonders.

## SveleteKit

These days the web community is going back to its roots **SSG-->MPA-->SPA-->SSR-->ALL-ATONCEüòÇ**. So even Svelte got into this bandwagen and started [SVELTEKIT](https://kit.svelte.dev/). Svelete has had a met-framework named sapper but it always felt half-baked implementation comapared to something like **Next.js**. So I was quite exited when sveltekit was launched.As promised svelte team kept its promise and delivered a great product.

But still svelete eventhough was consistantly becoming one of the most loved frameworks day by day , the adoption of it in big projects or comapnies was very rare, untill the entry of **vercel**.Vercel hired Rich and got him into developing sveltekit fulltime.This also helped getting sveletekit out soo fast.After this i could see all kinds websites showcasing the svelte logo.

Although the community of svlete is small comapred to something like React the community is growing at an exponential rate without a horizon.State if Js survey is a proof of it.
